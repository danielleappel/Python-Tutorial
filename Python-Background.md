# Python Background

### Creater, Creation Date, and Purpose
Guido van Rossum started developing the first version of Python in 1989 in the Netherlands as a hobby project around the winter holidays. The first official release was in 1991. Python was developed to create easily readable code that utilizes whitespace. It also features dynamic typing and garbage collection.

### Characteristics
Like Java, Python is an object-oriented language. It also supports structured programming and even offers some support on functional programming from the Lisp style. Furthermore, when used in web applications, Python can also serve as a scripting language.

### Compiled vs. interpreted + virtual machine
Python is an interpreted language. Unlike many languages that convert code into machine readable code, Python instead converts code into byte code in a .py file. This requires a stack-based python virtual machine. The job of the interpreter is to verify the validity of all variable types and operations performed. Since Python is an interpreted language, it is often critiqued as being a “slow” language. While it does take more time to convert code to byte code, Python is redeemed by its readability and quick development/writing time.

### Uses
As a general-purpose language, Python can be used a variety of settings. Python can be used for Machine Learning, Web and Internet Development, Scientific and Numeric Computing, Desktop GUIs, Software Development and Business Applications. Software Development uses of Python can involve build control, management, and automated testing. Using Python in Business Applications can employ Enterprise Resource Planning and e-commerce systems.
